Client Server Demonstration

GET Request: An internet request for data. Sent from a client to a server.

Response: A server's response to a request. Sent from a server to a client. A response to a GET request will usually include data that the client needs to load the page's content.

AJAX

- can happen in the background without blocking the rest of the page load
