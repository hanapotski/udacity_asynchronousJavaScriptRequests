XHR Usage Review
There are a number of steps you need to take to send an HTTP request asynchronously with JavaScript.

To Send An Async Request
create an XHR object with the XMLHttpRequest constructor function
use the .open() method - set the HTTP method and the URL of the resource to be fetched
set the .onload property - set this to a function that will run upon a successful fetch
set the .onerror property - set this to a function that will run when an error occurs
use the .send() method - send the request
To Use The Response
use the .responseText property - holds the text of the async request's response
Note: The original XHR specification was created in 2006. This was version 1 of the specification. A number of years with minimal changes to the spec.

In 2012, work was started on a version 2 of the XHR specification. In 2014, the XHR2 spec was merged into the XHR1 spec so that there wouldn't be diverging standards. There are still references to XHR2, but the XHR specification now fully incorporates XHR2.
