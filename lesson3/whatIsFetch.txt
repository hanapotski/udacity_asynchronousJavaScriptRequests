What is Fetch
Fetch is the new way to make network requests.

As mentioned above, the new Fetch API utilizes Promises under the hood

Fetch is a new API that was built to make requesting resources (primarily across a network) a whole lot easier. One thing that makes the new Fetch API a lot nicer than the old XHR way of doing things is that Fetch is promise-based!

fetch('<URL-to-the-resource-that-is-being-requested>');

- a Fetch request is just the fetch() function and a string to the resource that's being requested.

fetch('https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?page=1&query=flowers');

fetch(https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?page=1&query=${searchedForText}, { 
     headers: { 
         Authorization: 'Client-ID abc123' 
    } 
});


const requestHeaders = new Headers(); 
requestHeaders.append('Authorization', 'Client-ID abc123'); 
fetch(https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?page=1&query=${searchedForText}, { 
     headers: requestHeaders 
});

Changing The HTTP Method
So the default HTTP method for a Fetch request is the GET method. We can choose a different HTTP method by passing a method property in the configuration object:

fetch(`https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?page=1&query=${searchedForText}`, {
    method: 'POST'
});
This will send the request with the POST HTTP header.

Fetch's specification does not limit what HTTP methods can be used, although it does recommend that all methods are written in uppercase for consistency with the HTTP Verbs specification.
